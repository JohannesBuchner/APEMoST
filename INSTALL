You have to install the following packages for dependencies:

gsl (GNU Scientific Library)
boehmgc (Garbage Collector) 
	unless you use -DWITHOUT_GARBAGE_COLLECTOR
duma (optional)
	install them using your package manager. 

Compile:
	make clean all tests doc

	This should never give you errors. Check running this command before 
	committing a revision.  

	Check that you have a reasonably new gcc (i.e. gcc-4).






____________________________________________

Alternative way to install the dependencies:
	**Only if you can't install with a package** (e.g. no root rights or no package)!
	download+extract each tar and run 
		./configure --prefix=/home/buchner/bin/
		make; make install
	to install it locally
	To run with the locally installed libraries and headers, you have to 
	set
	CCFLAGS="-I /home/buchner/bin/include/ -L /home/buchner/bin/lib/" 
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/buchner/bin/lib/
