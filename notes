/*
 * PTR_NEW:
 *   creates a pointer to a heap variable
 *   argument is copied and a pointer is returned.
 **
 * with foo and bar being pointers
 *   bar = foo lets bar point to the same values as foo
 *   *bar = foo changes the values of bar to the same ones as foo (copy)
 *   * does dereferencing
 **
 * DBLARR:
 *   creates a double/float array/vectro
 *   argument: dimension, up to 8
 **
 * (*var)[a,b]
 *   dereferences pointer, accesses index a of var, and of that accesses index b
 * (*var)[a,*]
 *   full vector of 2D array (*var), var being a pointer to the 2D-array
 **
 * ?INDGEN:
 *   generates a array where each entry has the value of its subscript.
 *   examples: findgen (float), dindgen (double)
 *
 **
 * Histograms:
 *   count stuff that falls into bins.
 *   return the number of elements in the bin for each bin.
 *   usual arguments: nbins, min, max
